# BINARY CLASSIFICATION
## Aim:
To write a python program to perform binary classification.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner /Google Colab
## Related Theoritical Concept:
```
Binary classification is a form of classification — the process of predicting categorical variables — where the output is
restricted to two classes. It is used in many different data science applications, such as Medical Diagnosis,
Email analysis, Marketing, etc. For example, in medical diagnosis, a binary classifier for a specific disease 
could take in symptoms of a patient and predict whether the patient is healthy or has a disease. 
The possible outcomes of the diagnosis are positive and negative.
```
## Algorithm
```
1.Import the necessary modules.
2.Create the Dataset using make_blob function.
3.Assign the counter value using the Counter Function and with the help of a for loop iterate over the values.
4.Plot the row values in the graph.
```
## Program:
```

```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the python program performed binary classification successfully.
